### Nu-sense

Nu-sense is a software that gathers data from multiple sensors and outputs an estimated value using sensor fusion methods with uncertainty.

This implementation uses an algorithm discussed in this paper:
"A Simple Multi-sensor Data Fusion Algorithm Based on Principal Component Analysis" by GAO Hongyan
